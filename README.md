# Farmlogs

Run the following command inside the source directory:

```text
$  node .
```

This will run the program, and ask you which category you'd like to append to. This runs on a local server on port 8080. Use any modern browser and enter `localhost:8080` in order to access the web app.



Using the arrow keys, navigate between options, and click Enter to select which category to append a change to.

```text
? Where do you want to append to changelogs? (Use arrow keys)
> Added 
  Changed 
  Removed 
```



To close the program click `Enter` or use `Ctrl + C`

```text
$ ^C
```



That's it! It's that simple. This is under active development, so expect major changes and updates.
