# Farmlogs

Run Farmlogs using the following command:

```text
$ node .
```

This will run the program, and ask you which category you'd like to append to.



Using the arrow keys, navigate between options, and click Enter to select which category to append a change to.

```text
? Where do you want to append to changelogs? (Use arrow keys)
> Added 
  Changed 
  Removed 
```



To close the program, click `Enter` or use `Ctrl + C`

```text
$ ^C
```



That's it! It's that simple. This is under active development, so expect major changes.
